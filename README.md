# CUBOCALYPSE
Run for your life in this post apocalyptic world where cubes have invaded everything. [Link to my game](https://zarakirage0.itch.io/cubocalypse)

## ABOUT
The game is hosted in [itch.io](https://zarakirage0.itch.io/cubocalypse).
This is my first take ever on making games.
I've followed [Brackeys](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYbK_tjZ2OrIZFBvU6CCMiA)'s series on how to create a 3D game in Unity.
The tutorial is quite good as it gives you a first hand experience on game dev.
I hope you enjoy the game!

MOUSE to move the camera.
